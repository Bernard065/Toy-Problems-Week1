Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.


In the Vs code, open the terninal and run node speeddetector.js. It should give you a prompt to enter car speed.
