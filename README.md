Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

In the Vs code, open the terninal and run node studentgrades.js. It should give you a prompt to enter students marks.

For example 

bebeni@bebeni-840-G4:~/Development/code/Toy-Problems-Week1$ node studentgrades.js
Please a value between 0 and 100: 




Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.


In the Vs code, open the terninal and run node speeddetector.js. It should give you a prompt to car speed.

For example 

bebeni@bebeni-840-G4:~/Development/code/Toy-Problems-Week1$ node speeddetector.js
Please Enter Car Speed:
